- var -> we can redeclare the var
eg. var a; --> declaration , a=2 --> Assingment, var a = 5 --> ReDeclaration and Assingment

- Hositing -> when we print before the declaration and it will give the undefined only in var possible

- let -> We can reassign the value but can not redeclare

- const -> we can not only declare the value using cosnt we have to assign also

- undefined and NUll
            var value;  
            console.log(value, typeof(value)); --> type will be undefined
            value = null; --> assign value null
            console.log(value, typeof(value)); --> type will be object (this is the design mistake in the javascript)

- array inbuilt fuction --> push, pop, slice, splice, shift, unshift

- There are 6  falsey value in javascript --> null, undefined, "", false, NaN, 0
