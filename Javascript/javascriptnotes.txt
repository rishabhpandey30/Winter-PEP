- var -> we can redeclare the var
eg. var a; --> declaration , a=2 --> Assingment, var a = 5 --> ReDeclaration and Assingment

- Hositing -> when we print before the declaration and it will give the undefined only in var possible

- let -> We can reassign the value but can not redeclare

- const -> we can not only declare the value using cosnt we have to assign also

- undefined and NUll
            var value;  
            console.log(value, typeof(value)); --> type will be undefined
            value = null; --> assign value null
            console.log(value, typeof(value)); --> type will be object (this is the design mistake in the javascript)

- array inbuilt fuction --> push, pop, slice, splice, shift, unshift
                           **in arr we only use for of loop not for in**

- There are 6  falsey value in javascript --> null, undefined, "", false, NaN, 0 

- Logical operator -> It will give priority to the & operator first
        || (or) operator -> it will give the first truthy value if truthy is present
                            it will give the last falsy value when all the value are false
        & (and) operator -> it will give the first falsely value if any one value is false
                            it will give the last truthy value when all the value are truth

- Coercion -> converting the data implicitly(auto conversion)

- When we try to explicitly convert the number which is not a number then it will give me the NaN

Primitive datatype is store in the stack and changing one do not affect the other
but in non Primitive datatype it is store on the heap and the address is stored so if we 
change the one other get change automatically 
for eg . -> a = 12 , b =a then if we change the a then b will not affect
            a = [1,2,3] b =a if we chamge a then b will automatically update as it is stored as address
