- Babel -> IT convet the morden js to old, for eg. - Browsers DO NOT understand JSX.
                                                    JSX:
                                                    <h1>Hello</h1>

                                                    Babel converts it into:
                                                    React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");

- Imperative Programming (HOW to do things)  -> You tell the computer step-by-step instructions.

- Declarative Programming (WHAT you want) -> You describe what the UI should look like, and React handles how to update it.
                                            focus on result

- React.Fragment -> we can insert the multiple parent inside it without it we cann't
                    used to group multiple elements without adding an extra HTML tag to the DOM.
                    To use : <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
