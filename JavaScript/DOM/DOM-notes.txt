- DOM Manipulation -> Making website dynamic
                getElementByID, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, querySelectorAll

- When we access though class name and tag name it give the HTML collection(array like object but not array) which contain all tag

- In querySelector it give the first tag or first thing

- In querySelectorAll it will give the NodeList(it is array)

- Difference Between NodeList and HTML collection -> NodeList is Static where as other is dynamic

- innerText and innerHTML -> innerText give the text only which is present inside the tag
                            innerHTML give the everything present inside the tag including tags 

 - Debouncing is a technique used to limit how many times a function runs, especially when an event fires repeatedly.
